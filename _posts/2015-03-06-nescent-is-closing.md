title: NESCent is closing
---

As you may be aware, NESCent is closing in June 2015.  Over the past 10 years, NESCent and NESCent scientists have created many websites, datasets, software packages and other online content. If you were part of a NESCent-funded project, there is a **March 30, 2015** deadline for updating products or obtaining copies of NESCent-hosted resources. See the following two sections for details. 

**Inventory of NESCent products**

When NESCent closes, we will deposit with Duke Libraries an archive of the digital artifacts that resulted from the scientific projects, activities, and operations of the Center. The major public component of this archive will be an inventory of all NESCent projects and associated products. 

For each project, the inventory will list private artifacts in the archive (mailing lists, wikis, participant records) and publicly available products (journal articles, source code, data sets). We have posted [examples of inventory entries for a few projects]( {{ "/asset_inventory" }} ). 

Analysis of NESCent products will help to understand the impact of NSF's investment in evolutionary synthesis and inform future synthesis activities both in the US and globally ([http://synthesis-consortium.org/]()). We therefore plan to deposit a copy of the inventory in a public digital repository, likely [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/) or [Figshare](http://figshare.com/). 

If you have citations to products - publications, software, data, grants or other research artifacts - that are not already in the [NESCent database](http://nead.nescent.org), please take the time to add these before **March 30, 2015**. If you aren't sure what products are already associated with your project, you can search for your project on the [NESCent project page](http://nescent.org/science/awards.php) (see an [example project page](http://nescent.org/science/awards_summary.php?id=150)).  

Please help us to fully record the impact that NESCent has had on the evolutionary biology community. 

**NESCent hosted content**

If you have NESCent-hosted content (wiki, mailing list, DSCR account, or other resource) associated with your project, please see our description of [what will happen to NESCent assets]( {{ "/digital_assets" }} ). If you want a copy of your content, contact us before **March 30, 2015**.
