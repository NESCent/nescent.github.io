If you had a wiki, mailing list, Duke Cluster account or other online resource through NESCent, this page describes what will happen to that resource when NESCent closes and how to access your data before then.

## Wikis and mailing lists

## DSCR accounts
If you had an account on the Duke Shared Cluster Resource, you will need to move the files in your home directory to another location (noting that the DSCR was never to be a permanent home for data).

## Source code
All NESCent source code is open source and available from the [NESCent GitHub organization](https://github.com/nescent).

## Hosted applications
If NESCent hosts an application that is the product of your NESCent project, you should have already received an email about transferring that application to another institution and / or sending an archive of the data. All source code is on the [NESCent GitHub organization](https://github.com/nescent).
